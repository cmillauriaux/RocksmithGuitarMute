        ### 🚀 Quick Start
        1. Download `RockSmithGuitarMute-windows.zip`
        2. Extract to a folder of your choice
        3. Run `RockSmithGuitarMute.exe`
        4. Select your PSARC files and output directory
        5. Click "Start Processing"
        
        ### 🔧 Advanced Usage
        For developers or users who want to run from source:
        1. Download `RockSmithGuitarMute-source.zip`
        2. Install Python 3.8+ and dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
